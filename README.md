# My-Compiler
Project during academic course.

This Project is a Recursive Descent compiler that combines Lexical, Syntactic and Semantic Analyzers for simple programming language.

In order for us to use Recursive Descent method, a number of preparations for the original language were required:

*Left factoring.

*Left recursion.

*Nullable, First, Follow Table.

The compiler was written in C programming language with an Visual Studio environment.
